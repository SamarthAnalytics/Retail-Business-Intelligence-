# Retail BI Starter (DuckDB + SQL + Streamlit)

A compact, end-to-end **Business Intelligence project** that demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable insights using open-source tools.

This project integrates **DuckDB**, **SQL**, and **Streamlit** to build a lightweight data warehouse, define analytical metrics, and visualize them interactively — ideal for showcasing end-to-end analytics and dashboarding skills.

## Project Overview

The goal is to simulate a realistic retail analytics workflow:
1. **ETL Pipeline** – Load, clean, and transform retail data using Python and Pandas.  
2. **Analytics Warehouse** – Store processed data in a DuckDB database for fast querying.  
3. **SQL Metrics Layer** – Define KPIs such as revenue, gross margin, and repeat purchase rate using SQL.  
4. **Streamlit Dashboard** – Build a clean BI dashboard for interactive data exploration.
